## Overview
A landing page that integrates with the ShortUrl API to mainly shorten URLs [https://rapidapi.com/Walter678/api/shorturl9/]

### The project
This project provides a web interface for a URL shortening API, allowing users to input a long URL and receive a shortened version that can be used for sharing links. The landing page is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to quickly generate shortened URLs.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
- The `input` field is empty

## Unit Tests

This project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests written using the Jasmine testing framework to ensure the reliability and functionality of the codebase.

### Testing Framework

We have utilized Jasmine, a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. Jasmine provides a clean and intuitive syntax for defining and running tests, making it an ideal choice for our testing needs.

### Setup and Configuration

To run the unit tests locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Jasmine using npm:


2. Configure the test environment and setup any necessary dependencies.

### Writing Tests

Our unit tests are organized into separate spec files and cover critical functionality within the application. Each test case follows the Jasmine syntax for assertions and expectations, ensuring thorough validation of our code.

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests, execute the following command:
