## Overview
A landing page that integrates with the ShortUrl API to mainly shorten URLs [https://rapidapi.com/Walter678/api/shorturl9/]

### The project
This project provides a web interface for a URL shortening API, allowing users to input a long URL and receive a shortened version that can be used for sharing links. The landing page is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to quickly generate shortened URLs.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
- The `input` field is empty
